# Work with Git
It was great opportunity to learn such commands within git creation: clone,initialization, branches and pushing

For task1.1 I made:
4 branches:
1. [main]:(https://github.com/lidia3/DevOps_online_Zhytomyr_2021Q2/tree/main/m1/task1.1) This branch was used for merging develop branch 
2. [develop]:(https://github.com/lidia3/DevOps_online_Zhytomyr_2021Q2/tree/develop/m1/task1.1) This branch was used for merging images branch and style branch
3. [images]: (https://github.com/lidia3/DevOps_online_Zhytomyr_2021Q2/tree/images/m1/task1.1) This branch was used for keeping images and creating img src
4. [style]:(https://github.com/lidia3/DevOps_online_Zhytomyr_2021Q2/tree/styles/m1/task1.1) This branch was used for keeping styles folder and put src style to index.html
 
**Result**:Finally I have realised how to manage branches, also it was very useful practicewithin mergeing branches to final prod/resolving conflicts between them. After successfull merging we can see completed result as index page with styles and images.

# DevOps by own words
DevOps is one of mindset, one of the working ways to produce things from development site into the production stage. So devops is a concept that is used in the app lifecycle management and making sure that you are working in the sync with dev team
