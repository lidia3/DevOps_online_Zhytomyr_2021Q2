## Task 23:

Router is compatible with NAT but switch is not.
A switch is a networking device, which provides the facility to share the information & resources by connecting different network devices, such as computers, printers, and servers, within a small business network. A router is a networking device used to connect multiple switches and their corresponding networks to build a large network. These switches and their corresponding networks may be in a single location or different locations.
